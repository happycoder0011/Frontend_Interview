# File Explorer

## Problem Statement

- Have a json data for file and folder nested structure
- Have a add file and add folder buttons
- On clicking those buttons a text input of adding name should be there and on enter create the file/folder
- If text input empty then on clicking outside it should disappear.
  
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
